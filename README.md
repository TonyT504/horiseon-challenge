# Code Refactor Starter Code


For this challenge the goal was to address a marketing agency's request to make their site more accessible and optimized for search engines. 

Acceptance criteria: 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In the HTML file and CSS stylesheet above refactored sections, you'll see comments that'll describe the changes made.
